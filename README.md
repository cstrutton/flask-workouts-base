# flask-workouts-base
flask-workouts is a collection of my scratch pads.  I use them to work out new concepts in flask.  Base contains hello world boilerplate using flask-script.
## Usage
clone the repo
virtualenv env
env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
Checkout a new branch and start experimenting.

Look for several repos as I explore various aspects of flask.
